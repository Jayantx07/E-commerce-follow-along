## MILESTONE1 :-
1. Set Up the Development Environment
Installed all the necessary tools and dependencies to set up the development environment for the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project. This includes configuring the backend and frontend dependencies to ensure smooth development.
2. Understand Server-Client Interaction
Gained an understanding of how the frontend (React) interacts with the backend (Node.js/Express) using APIs. Focused on how the client sends requests to the server, and how the server processes them and sends back responses.
3. Set Up a Simple Server
Created a basic server using Node.js and Express, laying the foundation for the project. The server is set up to handle API requests and provide a foundation for future endpoints and business logic.

## MILESTONE 2  :-
1. Create a Structured Folder Hierarchy
Designed and implemented a structured folder hierarchy for the project, organizing the files in a way that ensures easy maintainability and scalability for both the frontend and backend.
2. Set Up React App (Frontend) and Node.js Server (Backend)
Frontend: Set up a React app to serve as the user interface for the project.
Backend: Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests, providing the foundation for server-side logic and database interaction.
3. Configure Tailwind CSS for Styling
Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS into the project to streamline the styling process and improve the overall design flexibility with utility-first CSS.
4. Add Optional Extensions for Development Efficiency
Installed and configured optional extensions such as Prettier, ESLint, and others to improve code formatting, quality, and overall development workflow.
5. Build a Functional and Styled Login Page (Frontend)
Developed and styled a Login Page for the frontend using React, Tailwind CSS, and connecting it to the backend for user authentication functionality.

---
## MILESTONE3 :- 
1. Set Up Dedicated Folders for Organizing Backend Code
Created dedicated folders for organizing the backend code. This ensures better structure and maintainability of the server-side code, with clear separation of concerns.
2. Initialized and Configured a Node.js Server
Set up a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests. This provides the backbone for the backend, allowing it to process incoming requests and return responses.
3. Connected the Application to MongoDB
Established a connection to MongoDB, enabling the application to store and manage data in a NoSQL database. This allows for flexible data handling and seamless interactions with the backend.
4. Implemented Basic Error Handling
Incorporated basic error handling in the server to ensure smooth operation. This handles potential errors gracefully, improving the reliability and stability of the application.
